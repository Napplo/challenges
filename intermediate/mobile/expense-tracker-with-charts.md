# Expense Tracker with Charts

## Overview
Create a comprehensive mobile application that allows users to record, categorize, and visualize their financial transactions. This intermediate-level challenge focuses on building a practical finance tool with insightful data visualization, offline capabilities, and a smooth user experience.

## Goal
Build a mobile expense tracking application that helps users monitor their spending habits through intuitive data entry and meaningful visual representations of their financial data.

## Required Features
- **Transaction management**: Allow users to add, edit, and delete expense and income transactions with details including amount, date, category, and optional notes
- **Category system**: Implement a customizable category system with both predefined categories (e.g., Food, Transportation, Housing) and user-created categories
- **Data visualization**: Create interactive charts that show spending patterns, including:
  - Breakdown of expenses by category (pie chart)
  - Spending trends over time (line chart)
  - Income vs. expenses comparison (bar chart)
- **Filtering and reporting**: Allow users to filter transactions by date range, category, or amount and generate simple reports
- **Offline functionality**: Ensure the app works without internet connection by implementing local storage of all data
- **Data persistence**: Save all transactions and user preferences to device storage
- **Data export**: Provide a way to export transaction data (e.g., CSV format)
- **Responsive UI**: Create an interface that adapts to different screen sizes and orientations

## Technical Requirements
- Chart rendering must be performant
- Smooth animations for chart transitions
