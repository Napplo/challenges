# Smart Receipt Scanner & Budget Analyzer

## Overview

Create an advanced mobile application that uses computer vision and OCR technology to automatically extract, categorize, and analyze data from photographed receipts. This advanced-level challenge focuses on implementing sophisticated image processing, data extraction algorithms, and intelligent financial analysis to transform physical receipts into structured financial data with minimal user intervention.

## Goal

Build a comprehensive financial management application that allows users to simply photograph receipts to automatically track expenses, with advanced recognition capabilities to extract merchant information, line items, taxes, and totals while providing insightful analytics and budgeting tools.

## Required Features

- **Receipt scanning**: Implement a camera interface with image optimization for receipt capture, with multi-angle correction and enhancement
- **Computer vision processing**: Create a robust image processing pipeline to identify receipt boundaries, correct perspective, and enhance readability
- **OCR implementation**: Develop or integrate OCR technology to extract text from receipt images with high accuracy
- **Intelligent data extraction**: Build algorithms to identify and categorize receipt data elements (merchant, date, items, prices, taxes, totals) 
- **Manual verification**: Allow users to verify and correct extracted data with an intuitive interface
- **Transaction classification**: Implement ML-based automatic categorization of purchases based on merchant and item descriptions
- **Data visualization**: Create interactive charts showing spending patterns across different dimensions:
  - Breakdown by merchant, category, and time period
  - Spending trends with predictive analysis
  - Budget adherence visualization
- **Receipt management**: Organize and store receipt images with searchable metadata
- **Export capabilities**: Generate comprehensive financial reports in multiple formats (PDF, CSV, etc.)
- **Offline processing**: Implement local processing capabilities when internet connectivity is unavailable

## Technical Requirements

- Achieve at least 90% accuracy in OCR extraction under normal lighting conditions
- Process and extract receipt data within 5 seconds on mid-range devices
- Implement efficient image storage with compression while maintaining readability
- Create a responsive, intuitive correction interface for misread receipt data
- Handle multiple currencies and international receipt formats
- Ensure secure storage of financial data with appropriate encryption
- Optimize battery usage during image processing

## Deliverables

- GitHub repository with complete source code
- README with setup instructions and feature overview
- 3 ~ 10 screenshots showcasing different app states
- Description of technical decisions and challenges overcome
